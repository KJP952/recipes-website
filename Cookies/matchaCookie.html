        <h4>What ingredients you will need:</h4>
        <h5>Serving: 16 Cookies</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups + 2 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp matcha powder</li>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 eggs room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
           <li>Brown your butter. Heat your butter over medium heat until it turns a golden yellow color. Pour butter in a heat proof bowl to cool. As the butter cools, it will get darker in color.</li>
           <li>Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and matcha powder in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix well and set aside.</li>
           <li>Next add in white sugar and brown sugar to your butter. Mix to combine. Once well combined, add in your eggs and vanilla. Whisk together. Whisk until you get a light and creamy texture (~1 minute). This is the key to getting a crisp and chewy cookie.</li>
           <li>Once the wet ingredients are well mixed, slowly add in the dry ingredients from step 3. Combine with a spatula until a green dough forms.</li>
           <li>Add in the white chocolate chips and mix until they are well incorporated.</li>
           <li>Let the dough rest in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
           <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
           <li>Cover 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a 3 tablespoon (1.5 oz) ice cream scoop to scoop cookie dough onto baking sheets. Cookies should be 2-3 inches apart.</li>
           <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes.</li>
           <li>Let cookies cool for 10 minutes before putting them on a cooling rack.</li>
           <li>Cool cookies for another 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
